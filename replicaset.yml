          # to create replicaset we run following commands
          # kubectl create/apply -f replicaset.yml
          # kubectl get replicaset
          # kubectl get pods

          # to scale replicaset
          # kubectl scale --replicas=6 -f replicaset.yml
          # or we can directly change in file and run commands as - kubectl replace -f replicaset.yml

          # to delete - kubectl delete replicaset myapp-ReplicaSet

          # you should use ReplicaSets (almost always managed automatically by a Deployment object). 

# notes
# it works same as replication controller. the difference are that it is part of apps/v1 API. And it  introduces improvements such as the mandatory selector field.
